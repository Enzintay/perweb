        <div class="info"> The goal of this project was to create two posters for two <br>
            seperate museum exhibits with the same style. I used a<br>
             large unsaturated image as a backdrop and placed the<br>
              text around the angles of the background. With three<br>
               colors, I created a small palette which made the<br>
                two posters look alike in design.
