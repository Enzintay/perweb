        <div class="info"> The typebook is consisted of animals from the Amazon rainforest recreated using only the letters of the animals name. <br>
            The focus of the project was to make the animals seem in motion using only type. This was achieved through playing with<br>
             opacity and afterimages to give the illusion of movement along with dynamic posing to suggest the motion of the animal.
