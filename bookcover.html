        <div class="info"> The concept for the book cover began with trying to keep with the original art style of the book with only black and white sketch art. <br>
            However, the aim of the project was to redesign with the goal in mind of rebranding and appealing to the audience of our time. <br>
            As such, in order to maintain a semblance of the original art style whilst appealing to a newer audience, I kept the sketch-like <br>
            outlines of the original but added color and gradients to give more life to the drawings on the cover.
